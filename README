This is an unofficial package designed for Fedora that packages
Mendeley Desktop freely available from the web.

It attempts to maximize the use of system libraries and to adhere to Fedora guidelines.

The only files I wrote were the .spec and a fresh mendeleydesktop executable (that essentially does nothing). Therefore I won't bother putting a license on my files. The license for the files obtained from Mendeley is included as part of this install.
